/**
 * <p>
 * You can use Amazon CloudWatch Evidently to safely validate new features by serving them to a specified percentage of
 * your users while you roll out the feature. You can monitor the performance of the new feature to help you decide when
 * to ramp up traffic to your users. This helps you reduce risk and identify unintended consequences before you fully
 * launch the feature.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can also conduct A/B experiments to make feature design decisions based on evidence and data. An experiment can
 * test as many as five variations at once. Evidently collects experiment data and analyzes it using statistical
 * methods. It also provides clear recommendations about which variations perform better. You can test both user-facing
 * features and backend features.
