 * Interface for accessing Amazon Recycle Bin.

 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.recyclebin.AbstractAmazonRecycleBin} instead.

 * This is the <i>Recycle Bin API Reference</i>. This documentation provides descriptions and syntax for each of the

 * <p>
 * Recycle Bin is a snapshot recovery feature that enables you to restore accidentally deleted snapshots. When using
 * Recycle Bin, if your snapshots are deleted, they are retained in the Recycle Bin for a time period that you specify.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can restore a snapshot from the Recycle Bin at any time before its retention period expires. After you restore a
 * snapshot from the Recycle Bin, the snapshot is removed from the Recycle Bin, and you can then use it in the same way
 * you use any other snapshot in your account. If the retention period expires and the snapshot is not restored, the
 * snapshot is permanently deleted from the Recycle Bin and is no longer available for recovery. For more information
 * about Recycle Bin, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/snapshot-recycle-bin.html">
 * Recycle Bin</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.
