# This file allows to configure the sentilo events which must be persisted by the relational agent in the target repository
# For each event to persist should be added a new property like the following:
#    topic=dataSource_1,..,dataSource_N
#
# where each topic must follow the following pattern: /{eventType}/{resourceId}, with
#  + eventType must be one of the following values: data, alarm or order
#  + resourceId could be any of the following listed below:
#         - *, if you want to persist all the events of this type
#         - providerId/*, if you want to persist all the events related to provider {providerId}
#         - providerId/sensorId if you only want to persist events related to the sensor {sensorId} from the provider {providerId}
#         - alertId if you only want to persist alarms from this alert.    
#
# and dataSource_1,..,dataSource_N is a list with the dataSource's names where the events will be persisted (the agent could persist 
# data in more than one repository simultaneously). Each dataSource name must be equal to one of the dataSource's names defined at 
# the file relational-persistence-context.xml.
#
# For example, if we have configured two dataSources with names sentiloDs and startDs and we want to persist all in the sentiloDs
# target repository and persist in the startDs target repository only the data published by a provider with identifier START, one possible 
# configuration could be the following:
# /data/*=sentiloDs
# /order/*=sentiloDs
# /alarm/*=sentiloDs
# /data/START*=startDs
#
