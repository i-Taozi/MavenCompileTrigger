/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon Detective asynchronously. Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future object
 * representing the asynchronous operation; overloads which accept an {@code AsyncHandler} can be used to receive
 * notification when an asynchronous operation completes.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.detective.AbstractAmazonDetectiveAsync} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to help you to analyze and investigate security
 * issues across your Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services) workloads. Detective automatically extracts time-based
 * events such as login attempts, API calls, and network traffic from CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
 * (Amazon VPC) flow logs. It also extracts findings detected by Amazon GuardDuty.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of behavior graphs. A behavior graph contains the
 * extracted data from a set of member accounts, and is created and managed by an administrator account.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To add a member account to the behavior graph, the administrator account sends an invitation to the account. When the
 * account accepts the invitation, it becomes a member account in the behavior graph.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Detective is also integrated with Organizations. The organization management account designates the Detective
 * administrator account for the organization. That account becomes the administrator account for the organization
 * behavior graph. The Detective administrator account can enable any organization account as a member account in the
 * organization behavior graph. The organization accounts do not receive invitations. The Detective administrator
 * account can also invite other accounts to the organization behavior graph.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Every behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API to manage behavior graphs that belong to the
 * Region that is associated with the currently selected endpoint.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The administrator account for a behavior graph can use the Detective API to do the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new behavior graph.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * View the list of member accounts in a behavior graph.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Add member accounts to a behavior graph.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Remove member accounts from a behavior graph.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Apply tags to a behavior graph.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The organization management account can use the Detective API to select the delegated administrator for Detective.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Detective administrator account for an organization can use the Detective API to do the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Perform all of the functions of an administrator account.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Determine whether to automatically enable new organization accounts as member accounts in the organization behavior
 * graph.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * An invited member account can use the Detective API to do the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * View the list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Accept an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Decline an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Remove their account from a behavior graph.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * All API actions are logged as CloudTrail events. See <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/adminguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html">Logging Detective API
 * Calls with CloudTrail</a>.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * We replaced the term "master account" with the term "administrator account." An administrator account is used to
 * centrally manage multiple accounts. In the case of Detective, the administrator account manages the accounts in their
 * behavior graph.
 * </p>
