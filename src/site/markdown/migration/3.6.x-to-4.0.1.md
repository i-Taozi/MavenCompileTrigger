# Migrating a project referencing finmath-lib from 3.6.3 to 4.0.5 (or higher).

## Refactorings

Version 4 of finmath-lib has been refactored in multiple aspects. For example, classes 
an packages have been renamed and moved. Some inner classes became outer classes.

Details on the refactorings can be found in `docs/refactoring-3.6.x-to-4.0.0/Refactorings 3.6.x to 4.0.0.xlsx`.

If you have a project referencing version 3.6.3 of finmath lib (or another version 3) you 
may refactor your project to be compatible with version 4.0.5 (or another version 4) 
by applying the *refactoring script* in `docs/refactoring-3.6.x-to-4.0.0/Refactorings 3.6.3 to 4.0.1.xml`.

## Refactoring Script

We provide an Eclipse refactoring script in `docs/refactoring-3.6.x-to-4.0.0/refactorings 3.6.3 to 4.0.1.xml`.
To apply the script, proceed as follows:

 - Open Eclipse. It is maybe advisable to start with a clean workspace.
 - Checkout finmath lib from git and import it into Eclipse workspace.
 - Switch to branch `3.6.x` in your finmath lib project.
 - Import your project(s) that should be refactored (if the project is not under version 
   control with its latest changes checked in, a backup might be advisable).
 - Let your project reference the finmath lib project in Eclipse:
    - Select Project -> Properties -> Java Build Path -> Projects
    - Add the finmath lib project form the workspace.
    - Select the `Order and Export` tab and ensure that the finmath lib project *comes before* the Maven references and any other binary reference.
    - Not required, but safer: you may consider removing any binary reference to finmath lib, e.g. by removing it from your projects pom.xml (if it is a maven project)..
 - Start the refactoring on the `finmath lib` project (not on your project). Your project 
   will be refactoring accordingly automatically, since it references `finmath lib`.
    - On finmath lib, select Refactor -> Apply Script.
    - Select `docs/refactoring-3.6.x-to-4.0.0/refactorings 3.6.3 to 4.0.1.xml`.
    - Select Finish.

After the refactoring is done you will see four error messages. These are warnings of 
similar type names and may be ignored.

## Finalizing the Migration

After the refactoring, the finmath lib project will show errors.
The reason for these errors is the refactoring of interfaces, changing return types or adding new methods, for 
which 3.6.x does not provide an implementation. For the finmath lib project the version 
4.0.1 provides the missing implementations. For your project it may be required that 
you add these implementations.

Thus the following steps have to be performed:
   - Switch the finmath lib project to the version 4.0.x branch.
   - Add missing implementations to your project and fix all other errors.
   - Remove the reference to the projects and add the corresponding binary reference 
     if required.


It is not guaranteed that the refactoring resolves all issues, but it may be helpful. 
Good luck!
