FeatureNameConversionTable_0=Special characters into the Java feature column:\n\
  - '*' means anything.\n\
  - 'P/y', where P is the path of the expression receiver, and y is the identifier of the feature.\n\
Special variables into the target feature column:\n\
  - '$0' means the receiver of the feature;\n\
  - '$n' are the arguments of the feature, where n>1.\n\
  - '$*' are the list of all the arguments.\n\
If the "Java feature" ends with "()" is a a feature call conversion; Otherwise, it is a declaration\n\
conversion. If the "Target feature" has not special variable, it is a simple feature renaming.
