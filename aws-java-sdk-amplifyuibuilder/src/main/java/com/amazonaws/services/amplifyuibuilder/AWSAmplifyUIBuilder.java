/**
 * Interface for accessing AWS Amplify UI Builder.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.amplifyuibuilder.AbstractAWSAmplifyUIBuilder} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * The Amplify UI Builder API provides a programmatic interface for creating and configuring user interface (UI)
 * component libraries and themes for use in your Amplify applications. You can then connect these UI components to an
 * application's backend Amazon Web Services resources.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can also use the Amplify Studio visual designer to create UI components and model data for an app. For more
 * information, see <a href="https://docs.amplify.aws/console/adminui/intro">Introduction</a> in the <i>Amplify
 * Docs</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Amplify Framework is a comprehensive set of SDKs, libraries, tools, and documentation for client app development.
 * For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.amplify.aws/">Amplify Framework</a>. For more information about
 * deploying an Amplify application to Amazon Web Services, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/welcome.html">Amplify Console User Guide</a>.
