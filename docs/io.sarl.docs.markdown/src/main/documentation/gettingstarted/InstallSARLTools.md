# Install SARL Tools

There are two easy ways to get SARL up and running. A pre-configured Eclipse distribution is available which has already all
the necessary plug-ins installed. Alternatively, you can install SARL SDK into your existing Eclipse using the Eclipse update
mechanism.

## Installation Instructions

You must follow the instructions given on the [download]([:sarlUrl!]/download/index.html) page for installing the SARL tools.
