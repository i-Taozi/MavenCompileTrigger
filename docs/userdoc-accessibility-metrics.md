# Tanaguru accessibility metrics

## Tanaguru Meter

The Tanaguru Meter gives insights about the accessibility of a page.

As it is based only on automated results, it is **not** the accessibility level
(except when an Assisted Audit is completed).

The Tanaguru Meter formula is: **Passed / (Passed + Failed) **
