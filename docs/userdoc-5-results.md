# Tanaguru's 5 types of accessibility results

Tanaguru presents five types of results.

The definitive results (given by the accessibility methodology itself):

* Passed
* Failed
* Not Applicable

The non-definitive results :

* **Pre-qualified**: any test where Tanaguru can't state reliably a definitive result
but cant actually bring any useful information, that will lead in **time-savings** for
the user
* **Not Tested**: all the other tests.
