 * <fullname>Backup gateway</fullname>
 * <p>
 * Backup gateway connects Backup to your hypervisor, so you can create, store, and restore backups of your virtual
 * machines (VMs) anywhere, whether on-premises or in the VMware Cloud (VMC) on Amazon Web Services.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Add on-premises resources by connecting to a hypervisor through a gateway. Backup will automatically discover the
 * resources in your hypervisor.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Use Backup to assign virtual or on-premises resources to a backup plan, or run on-demand backups. Once you have
 * backed up your resources, you can view them and restore them like any resource supported by Backup.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To download the Amazon Web Services software to get started, navigate to the Backup console, choose <b>Gateways</b>,
 * then choose <b>Create gateway</b>.
 * </p>
