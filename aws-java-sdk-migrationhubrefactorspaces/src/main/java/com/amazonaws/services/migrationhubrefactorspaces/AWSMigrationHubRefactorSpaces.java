     * <code>DEFAULT</code> <code>RouteType</code>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When you create a route, Refactor Spaces configures the Amazon API Gateway to send traffic to the target service
     * as follows:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If the service has a URL endpoint, and the endpoint resolves to a private IP address, Refactor Spaces routes
     * traffic using the API Gateway VPC link.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If the service has a URL endpoint, and the endpoint resolves to a public IP address, Refactor Spaces routes
     * traffic over the public internet.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If the service has an Lambda function endpoint, then Refactor Spaces uses the API Gateway Lambda integration.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * A health check is performed on the service when the route is created. If the health check fails, the route
     * transitions to <code>FAILED</code>, and no traffic is sent to the service.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For Lambda functions, the Lambda function state is checked. If the function is not active, the function
     * configuration is updated so that Lambda resources are provisioned. If the Lambda state is <code>Failed</code>,
     * then the route creation fails. For more information, see the <a href=
     * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_GetFunctionConfiguration.html#SSS-GetFunctionConfiguration-response-State"
     * >GetFunctionConfiguration's State response parameter</a> in the <i>Lambda Developer Guide</i>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For public URLs, a connection is opened to the public endpoint. If the URL is not reachable, the health check
     * fails. For private URLs, a target group is created and the target group health check is run.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The <code>HealthCheckProtocol</code>, <code>HealthCheckPort</code>, and <code>HealthCheckPath</code> are the same
     * protocol, port, and path specified in the URL or health URL, if used. All other settings use the default values,
