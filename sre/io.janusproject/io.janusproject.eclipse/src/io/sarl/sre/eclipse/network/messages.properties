JanusLaunchNetworkTab_5=This panel enables the configuration of the networking features of the Janus SARL Runtime Environment.\n\
 It is based on the Hazelcast library for supporting the communication between the SRE kernels over the network.
JanusLaunchNetworkTab_6=<root context id>
JanusLaunchNetworkTab_7=Each SRE kernel is an Hazelcast node.\n\
 These nodes may interact with the other nodes over a computer\n\
 network when they are inside the single Hazelcast group, named\n\
 cluster. In order to create different clusters in parallel, each\n\
 cluster is identified by its name. You could specify explicitly\n\
 the cluster''s name with this configuration parameter. If you do\n\
 not specify a name, the SRE will use the default value\n\
 ''{0}'', where\n\
 ''{1}'' is the identifier of the root\n\
 agent context in the SRE.\n\
 Caution: even if the SRE nodes are not connected to clusters with\n\
 different names, there is no warranty about the privacy of exchanged\n\
 messages within a cluster. In other words, it is still technically\n\
 possible to connect an Haselcast node to the cluster for obtaining the\n\
 exchanged messages.

JanusLaunchNetworkTab_10=Each SRE kernel is an Hazelcast node.\n\
 These nodes may interact with the other nodes over a computer\n\
 network when they are inside the single Hazelcast group, named\n\
 cluster. The minimal number of members in a cluster is a strict\n\
 constraint that indicates the Hazelcast infrastructure is waiting\n\
 for the given number of cluster members before starting. A consequence\n\
 of this constraint is that a SRE is blocked until the Hazelcast framework\n\
 has built a cluster with the given amount of members.\n\
 The default value for the minimal number of members is {1}.
JanusLaunchNetworkTab_11=Hazelcast Configuration
JanusLaunchNetworkTab_12=TCP/IP cluster members list, no discovery, coma-separated list of the node IPs ({0}={1}): 
JanusLaunchNetworkTab_13=Multicast cluster members discovery ({0}={1})
JanusLaunchNetworkTab_14=This does not match with a list of IP addresses separated with commas (i.e.: 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.2, 192.168.0.3)
JanusLaunchNetworkTab_15=<mode>
JanusLaunchNetworkTab_16=The kernel discovery is the mechanism used by Hazelcast for discovery the instances of Hazelcast\
 over a computer network. The kernel discovery method based on TCP/IP addresses enables Hazelcast to discover the nodes \
 only on the computers for which the IP address is specified. Therefore, the list of the IP addresses of all the computers \
 that are involved into the Hazelcast cluster must be specified, separated by commas. 
JanusLaunchNetworkTab_17=The kernel discovery is the mechanism used by Hazelcast for discovery the instances of Hazelcast\
 over a computer network. The kernel discovery method based on multicast enables Hazelcast to discover the nodes \
 by sending a multicast message on the computer network.
