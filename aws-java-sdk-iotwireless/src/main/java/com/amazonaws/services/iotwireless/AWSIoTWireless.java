/**
 * Interface for accessing AWS IoT Wireless.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.iotwireless.AbstractAWSIoTWireless} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * AWS IoT Wireless provides bi-directional communication between internet-connected wireless devices and the AWS Cloud.
 * To onboard both LoRaWAN and Sidewalk devices to AWS IoT, use the IoT Wireless API. These wireless devices use the Low
 * Power Wide Area Networking (LPWAN) communication protocol to communicate with AWS IoT.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Using the API, you can perform create, read, update, and delete operations for your wireless devices, gateways,
 * destinations, and profiles. After onboarding your devices, you can use the API operations to set log levels and
 * monitor your devices with CloudWatch.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can also use the API operations to create multicast groups and schedule a multicast session for sending a
 * downlink message to devices in the group. By using Firmware Updates Over-The-Air (FUOTA) API operations, you can
 * create a FUOTA task and schedule a session to update the firmware of individual devices or an entire group of devices
 * in a multicast group.
 * </p>
