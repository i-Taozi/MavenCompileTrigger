Spring Security
===============

[Spring Test MVC](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-test-mvc) is a good framework for testing Spring MVC application.

In this sample, we demonstrated a simple Calendar application, where a regular user can create a Event and can see others event but cannot modify them. Admin user can modify other user's event as well.

We will demonstrate the Spring Security capability for Inmemory authorization provider, JDBC authorization provider, LDAP authorization provider, CAS Single sign on authorization provider.
