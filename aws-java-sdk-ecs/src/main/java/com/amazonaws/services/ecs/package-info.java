/**
 * <fullname>Amazon Elastic Container Service</fullname>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service. It makes it
 * easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. You can host your cluster on a serverless
 * infrastructure that's managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks on Fargate. For more control, you can
 * host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that you manage.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon ECS makes it easy to launch and stop container-based applications with simple API calls. This makes it easy to
 * get the state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your resource needs,
 * isolation policies, and availability requirements. With Amazon ECS, you don't need to operate your own cluster
 * management and configuration management systems. You also don't need to worry about scaling your management
 * infrastructure.
 * </p>
